# Level Up

[My Notes](notes.md)

A brief description of the application here. 
This change was on github.


> [!NOTE]
>  This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

> [!NOTE]
>  If you are not familiar with Markdown then you should review the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax) before continuing.

### Elevator pitch

You've probably heard that it takes 10,000 hours to master a skill. Have you ever wondered how many hours you've invested in something? Have you ever wondered what kind of progress you have made? Ever wonder what skills your friends are working on? Level Up is github version control but for humans. It allows us to track how much time has been put into specific skills and note our progress along the way. You can set goals, track habits and work with friends all to help you become the best version of yourself you can be. Six months to sexy has never been so easy.
